### The Model

The model used in this project is Kinematic Bicycle Model which consists of following states:

 - `x`: The x position of the vehicle.
 - `y`: The y position of the vehicle.
 - `psi`: The orientation of the vehicle.
 - `v`: The current velocity.
 - `cte`: The Cross-Track-Error
 - `epsi`: The orientation error

The update equations are as following:

```cpp
fg[1 + x_start + t] = x1 - (x0 + v0 * CppAD::cos(psi0) * dt);
fg[1 + y_start + t] = y1 - (y0 + v0 * CppAD::sin(psi0) * dt);
fg[1 + psi_start + t] = psi1 - (psi0 + v0 * delta0 / Lf * dt);
fg[1 + v_start + t] = v1 - (v0 + a0 * dt);
fg[1 + cte_start + t] = cte1 - ((f0 - y0) + (v0 * CppAD::sin(epsi0) * dt));
fg[1 + epsi_start + t] = epsi1 - ((psi0 - psides0) + v0 * delta0 / Lf * dt);
```

### Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing

The waypoints from simulator are global coordinate system, but we have to transform them because all computations are performed in the vehicle coordinate system.

```cpp
double x = (ptsx[i] - px) * cos(psi) + (ptsy[i] - py) * sin(psi);
double y = -(ptsx[i] - px) * sin(psi) + (ptsy[i] - py) * cos(psi);
```

### Timestep Length and dt

At first, I started with `N=25` and `dt=0.05`. But I changed the values to `N=10` and `dt=0.2` because:

 - Smaller dt is better because it gives finer resolution.
 - But we have the 100ms latency, so I chose the larger value to deal with the latency.
 - Larger value than `N=10` is easy to miscalculate.
 - Smaller value thant `N=10` is not enough to caculate the trajectory.

### Latency

As noted above, I chose `dt=0.2` to deal with the latency. Also, I incorporated the latency into the model.

```cpp
Eigen::VectorXd state_vector(6);

double latency = 0.1;
double Lf = 2.67;

double x = v * cos(psi) * latency;
psi = v / Lf * delta * latency;
v = v + a * latency;

state_vector << x, 0, psi, v, cte, epsi;

auto results = mpc.Solve(state_vector, coeffs);
```
## Basic Build Instructions


1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.


## Dependencies

* cmake >= 3.5
 * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1(mac, linux), 3.81(Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools]((https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
* [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets)
  * Run either `install-mac.sh` or `install-ubuntu.sh`.
  * If you install from source, checkout to commit `e94b6e1`, i.e.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets
    cd uWebSockets
    git checkout e94b6e1
    ```
    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.
* Fortran Compiler
  * Mac: `brew install gcc` (might not be required)
  * Linux: `sudo apt-get install gfortran`. Additionall you have also have to install gcc and g++, `sudo apt-get install gcc g++`. Look in [this Dockerfile](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Quizzes/blob/master/Dockerfile) for more info.
* [Ipopt](https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt)
  * If challenges to installation are encountered (install script fails).  Please review this thread for tips on installing Ipopt.
  * Mac: `brew install ipopt`
       +  Some Mac users have experienced the following error:
       ```
       Listening to port 4567
       Connected!!!
       mpc(4561,0x7ffff1eed3c0) malloc: *** error for object 0x7f911e007600: incorrect checksum for freed object
       - object was probably modified after being freed.
       *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
       ```
       This error has been resolved by updrading ipopt with
       ```brew upgrade ipopt --with-openblas```
       per this [forum post](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/incorrect-checksum-for-freed-object/313433/19).
  * Linux
    * You will need a version of Ipopt 3.12.1 or higher. The version available through `apt-get` is 3.11.x. If you can get that version to work great but if not there's a script `install_ipopt.sh` that will install Ipopt. You just need to download the source from the Ipopt [releases page](https://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Ipopt/).
    * Then call `install_ipopt.sh` with the source directory as the first argument, ex: `sudo bash install_ipopt.sh Ipopt-3.12.1`.
  * Windows: TODO. If you can use the Linux subsystem and follow the Linux instructions.
* [CppAD](https://www.coin-or.org/CppAD/)
  * Mac: `brew install cppad`
  * Linux `sudo apt-get install cppad` or equivalent.
  * Windows: TODO. If you can use the Linux subsystem and follow the Linux instructions.
* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page). This is already part of the repo so you shouldn't have to worry about it.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [releases tab](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).
* Not a dependency but read the [DATA.md](./DATA.md) for a description of the data sent back from the simulator.


## Tips

1. It's recommended to test the MPC on basic examples to see if your implementation behaves as desired. One possible example
is the vehicle starting offset of a straight line (reference). If the MPC implementation is correct, after some number of timesteps
(not too many) it should find and track the reference line.
2. The `lake_track_waypoints.csv` file has the waypoints of the lake track. You could use this to fit polynomials and points and see of how well your model tracks curve. NOTE: This file might be not completely in sync with the simulator so your solution should NOT depend on it.
3. For visualization this C++ [matplotlib wrapper](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) could be helpful.

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
